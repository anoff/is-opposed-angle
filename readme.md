> check if two angles are in opposite direction


## Install

```
$ npm install --save is-opposed-angle
```


## Usage

Returns `true` if first and second argument are opposed angles. By default the angles must be passed in **radian**.

```js
const isOpposedAngle = require('is-opposed-angle');

isOpposedAngle(0, Math.PI);
//=> true

// Use the options argument for degrees
isOpposedAngle(0, 540, {isDegree: true});
//=> true
```


## API

### isOpposedAngle(angle1, angle2, [options]) : `Boolean`

#### angle1 [rad]

Type: `number`

First angle by default it is assumed to be in radian format. See _options_ for using other angle units.

#### angle2 [rad]

Type: `number`

Second angle by default it is assumed to be in radian format. See _options_ for using other angle units.

#### options

##### isDegree

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Interpret the `angle1` and `angle2` values in degrees.

##### tolerance [rad]

Type: `number`<br>
Default: `0.1`

If the angle difference is not exactly opposite but within `tolerance` it is still considered opposed. Should be supplied in same unit as angle.
